> Temple University Capstone 4398 Project

# Software Purpose:

Pic-a-Pup is a dog lovers dream, providing a simple and fun interface to change the way its users search, inform themselves, and begin the process of adopting that perfect forever friend. Taking a picture of a dog or uploading an image to the application will return the dog’s breed and general information about the breed. In addition, Pic-a-Pup will provide users with dog’s that match the identified breed that are available for adoption their local area.

Pic-a-Pup will also allow users to help dog owners in their community. A QR/RF tag on a lost dog’s collar can be scanned and the dog’s real-time GPS coordinates will be sent to the dog’s owner.

Users of Pic-a-Pup can also use the Android, iOS, and web applications to find dog care services such as, sitting, walking, training.

These features will be implemented through an Android, iOS, and web application connected to a back-end server and cloud platform that will supply the necessary data to the applications.
